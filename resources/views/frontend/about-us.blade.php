                            tapvCard was born out of a simple idea: to eliminate the hassle of carrying and
                            distributing physical business cards. We envisioned a future where exchanging
                            contact information would be as easy as a tap. With this vision in mind, we embarked
                            on a journey to create a digital solution that brings networking into the digital
                            age.</p>
